HarleyDroid: Harley Davidson J1850 Data Analyser for Android.

This Android application captures, decodes and analysed the J1850
stream coming from the data bus of a Harley Davidson bike.

Some of the decoded information (RPM, speed, odometer etc) is
shown on the screen and can be saved on the external storage (SDcard)
for later usage.

To use this application you will need:
- a Bluetooth ELM327 module (you can choose between the real one or
  a cheap Chinese clone - you can buy them at $25 on ebay)
- a custom cable interfacing the ELM327 module to the 3 pin
  data/diagnostic port on your bike (the port uses a 4 pin Deutsch
  connector and is placed near the battery on my Sportster):

  	Harley data port	  16 pin J1979 connector (ELM327)
